# G12Python

The following is code to simplify the pipeline of turning a nucleic acid sequence 
  into a table of predicted orthologous groups (KO numbers). It makes use of a few 
  prerequisite programs found in the INSTALLATION OF PREREQS text file, such as 
  Prodigal, KofamScan, and their own prerequisite files.

The code works on Linux, but as some of these prerequisite programs don't work
  on Windows/Mac, I can't attest to its ability on those platforms. A link to 
  download Ubuntu is included in the aforementioned text file. It's free, so if
  you can't get it to work, please try on Ubuntu.

I've included some files to test the program out for yourself, but encouurage you
  to head over to NCBI and download a genome to a critter that means something to you!

  Happy researching!



Also! If you're my professor (Hi Dr. Pan!!) and you want access to previous drafts of
the code, just let me know. We were using a Google Doc to keep track of successive 
edits before we received ouur lesson about GitHub. I'd upload it publicly, but it has..
some swears. Coding can be frustrating haha!
